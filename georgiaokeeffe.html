Starting with abstract charcoal drawings, she moved to paintings of New York City skyscrapers and images of flowers. After visiting northern New Mexico, her creations began going in a different direction: landscapes of the American Southweast. Finally, just before losing her eyesight, she began painting aerial views of the clouds and sky. The Georgia O'Keeffe Museum is in Santa Fe, NM, where she spent her last years.</p>
